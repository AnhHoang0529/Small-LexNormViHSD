# Small-LexNormViHSD
The Small-LexNormViHSD dataset is used for lexical normalization on Vietnamese social media text.

This dataset contains 2,181 annotated comments from the [ViHSD dataset](https://github.com/sonlam1102/vihsd), which is used for hate speech detection on social network sites.
Label: input (non-standard sentence), output(standard sentence)

abstract="Social media data is a valuable resource for research, yet it contains a wide range of non-standard words (NSW). These irregularities hinder the effective operation of NLP tools. Current state-of-the-art methods for the Vietnamese language address this issue as a problem of lexical normalization, involving the creation of manual rules or the implementation of multi-staged deep learning frameworks, which necessitate extensive efforts to craft intricate rules. In contrast, our approach is straightforward, employing solely a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model. In this research, we provide a dataset for textual normalization, comprising 2,181 human-annotated comments with an inter-annotator agreement of 0.9014. By leveraging the Seq2Seq model for textual normalization, our results reveal that the accuracy achieved falls slightly short of 70{\%}. Nevertheless, textual normalization enhances the accuracy of the Hate Speech Detection (HSD) task by approximately 2{\%}, demonstrating its potential to improve the performance of complex NLP tasks. Our dataset is accessible for research purposes (Github: https://github.com/AnhHoang0529/Small-LexNormViHSD).",
